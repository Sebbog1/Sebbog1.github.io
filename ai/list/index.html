    <h2>Text AI</h2>
	<a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat"><h3>ChatGPT</h3></a>
    <dt>ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence system developed by OpenAI that assists users with tasks and provides information on a variety of topics. It uses machine learning techniques to understand and generate text, allowing it to communicate with users and provide information and assistance on a range of queries and requests.</dt>
    <a href="https://beta.openai.com/playground/"><h3>GPT-3</h3></a>
    <dt>Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is a language model developed by OpenAI that utilizes deep learning to produce human-like text based on an initial prompt. Its architecture is a transformer network with 2048-token context and 175 billion parameters, and it was introduced in May 2020. Microsoft has obtained exclusive use of the model, but it is still accessible through the public API.</dt>
	<a href="https://www.vulgarlang.com/"><h3>Vulgar</h3></a>
    <dt>Vulgar is a language generation tool that uses artificial intelligence to generate languages. It was developed and designed in Sydney, Australia. It is available as a web application and allows users to create languages with a range of sounds and grammar rules.</dt>
    <h2>Image AI</h2>
    <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/home/"><h3>Midjourney</h3></a>
    <dt>Midjourney is an artificial intelligence program developed by an independent research lab that generates images from textual descriptions. It is available as a Discord bot and was made available in open beta on July 12, 2022. In August 2022, it was announced that the company behind Midjourney was already profitable. The Midjourney team is led by David Holz, who co-founded Leap Motion.</dt>
    <a href="https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/dream"><h3>Stable Diffusion</h3></a>
    <dt>Stable Diffusion is a deep learning model that generates images based on text descriptions. It was developed by the CompVis group at LMU Munich and released in 2022 by a collaboration of Stability AI, CompVis LMU, and Runway, with support from EleutherAI and LAION. It is a latent diffusion model, a type of deep generative neural network, and is publicly available to run on consumer hardware with a GPU and at least 8 GB of VRAM.</dt>
    <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/"><h3>DALL-E</h3></a>
    <dt>DALL-E and DALL-E 2 are deep learning models developed by OpenAI that generate digital images from natural language descriptions. DALL-E 2 is designed to generate more realistic images at higher resolutions. OpenAI has not made the source code for either model publicly available. DALL-E 2 is available as an API on a cost-per-image basis, with volume discounts for companies working with OpenAI's enterprise team. Access to DALL-E 2 was previously restricted, but it is now open to the general public. DALL-E was announced by OpenAI in January 2021, and DALL-E 2 in April 2022. The software's name is a portmanteau of the names of animated robot Pixar character WALL-E and Spanish surrealist artist Salvador Dal√≠.</dt>
